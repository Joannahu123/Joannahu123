# Welcome to my github pages

Hello! Welcome to my github pages, feel free to look around my repos and projects that I've worked on! Some of my projects include my personal blog, which you can find my progress of coding throughout the year. Other projects include an engineering project regarding data sciences, and a cookbook project about data creation, editing, and deleting. Thanks for stopping by!
